        </div>
        <p>The
          tower and bells were provided as a memorial to Queen Victoria’s
          Diamond Jubilee, the gift of the Dalgety family, then presumably
          Lords of the Manor, at a total cost of about £1,300. The ringing
          peal was originally installed in April 1898 as a ring of six bells,
          and was augmented to eight by the addition of two trebles completed
          on 18<sup>th</sup> April 1899. The bell frame as originally installed was designed and
          constructed to accommodate the eight bells, indeed quotations for the
          two additional bells were sought prior to the completion of the six.
        </p>
        <p>John Taylor &amp; Co. of Loughborough cast all the bells, to a modern
          design with a flat &ldquo;table&rdquo; top. They are all hung from their
          headstocks by means of bolts passing through the crown of each bell.
          All are fitted with an independent &ldquo;crown staple&rdquo; mechanism
          from which the clappers are suspended. In each case this bolts up
          through the crown of the bell and through the headstock.
        </p>
        <p>All the bells were &ldquo;machine&rdquo; tuned at the time of manufacture,
          broadly to the modern &ldquo;five-tone&rdquo; principle adopted by John
          Taylor and Co. in 1896. This would have been carried out in a
          vertical lathe. However, the tuning marks are slight and appear
          confined to the mouth and lower waist of each bell, suggesting that
          the &ldquo;partial&rdquo; harmonic tones created by the reverberation
          of the upper waist and crown of each bell may not have been fully
          tuned to modem standards. Information from John Taylor (Bellfounders)
          Ltd indicates that after tuning the &ldquo;Prime&rdquo; note of the
          tenor bell is F<sup>#</sup>,
          resonating at a frequency of 734 Hz which is 14 cents (a
          cent being one, one hundredths of a semitone) flat of F<sup>#</sup>
          standard pitch.
        </p>
        <p>The
          bells are hung from wooden headstocks carried on plain bearings.
          Seven of the bells are in a cast iron &ldquo;H pattern&rdquo; frame carried
          on timber bearers. The remining bell, the &ldquo;second&rdquo; is in a timber
          sub-frame above the third.
        </p>
        <p>The
          cost of the six bells including the frame and installation but
          excluding the cost of cartage from Dunbridge Railway Station to the
          church was £294. The cost of the two additional bells was £83-10-0.
        </p>
        <p>Apart
          from the replacement of a broken clapper, the bells have only
          required routine maintenance, are still in good order and are
          regularly rung for Sunday Service and other special occasions.

        <p>&ldquo;Secretary’s
          report.
        </p>
        <p>In
          various parts of the Diocese we hear that new rings of bells are
          receiving attention. At. New Alresford the Guild duly brought round
          an opening peal last December, while in April the first peal was
          scored on the Curdridge bells. At Merrow, near Guildford, a new peal
          of six (tenor 13 cwt 1 qr.), be Messrs Mears and Stainbank, was
          dedicated by the Archdeacon of Surrey on Easter Monday. [11<sup>th</sup>
          April 1898] At East Tytherley (Hants.) a new ring of six (tenor 14
          cwt. 1 qr.) has been erected by Messrs Taylor, but these bells have
          not yet been dedicated, as the tower is still incomplete. The Rev. S.
          F. Bourdillon, Vicar of East Tytherley, was formerly Rector of
          Lockerley, and during the 13 years he has spent in these two parishes
          he has seen a ring of six erected in each tower. Messrs Taylor, of
          Loughborough, are now engaged at Whitchurch. At Chale, Isle of Wight,
          and at Newdigate, Surrey, the bells have been rehung, while at Oakley
          some necessary repairs have been effected. At Twyford it is proposed
          to add a couple of trebles, while the tower at Crawley will be
          rebuilt and the bells restored, as soon as funds permit. Before many
          months are over it is hoped that the bells at Fordingbridge will be
          thoroughly overhauled, and a new frame put in.

        <h4>Extract
          from the front page of The Bell News and Ringing Record Saturday May

        </h4>
        <p>EAST
          TYTHERLEY, HANTS.
        </p>
        <p>Here
          on Saturday afternoon, April 29<sup>th</sup>,
          as will be seen in another column, the Winchester Diocesan Guild
          successfully accomplished an opening peal at the first attempt. The
          Vicar, the Rev. S. F. Bourdillon, is enthusiastic on the subject of
          bells. In the adjoining parish of Lockerley, where he was formerly
          Vicar for seven years, lie was largely instrumental in obtaining a
          handy ring of six by Taylor. In 1893 Mr. Bourdillon removed to East
          Tytherley, and when the question of a memorial of the Queen's Diamond
          Jubilee arose, it was decided to erect a tower and put therein a ring
          of six bells. The work was completed last year at a total cost of
          about £ 1,300. The new tower has been erected on the north side of
          the church, and its style of architecture blends harmoniously with
          the rest of the structure. Messrs. Taylor were again called upon to
          supply the new peal, and they have within the last month added a
          couple of trebles. Seven bells are on one level, and the 2nd is
          placed on girders above the iron H pattern frame. The bells have no
          cannons, and Messrs. Taylor have provided fittings, etc. of the
          latest pattern, including Sir Arthur Heywood's excellent grease
          boxes. The bells bear the names of members of the Dalgety family,
          with the exception of the treble, which has the Vicar's name on its
          waist, and the total cost of the bells and frame amounts to about
          £530. The tenor weighs 14 cwt.1qr. 5lbs.: its note is F.
        </p>
        <p>Everyone
          was delighted with the melodious tone of these bells, and while the
          opening peal was
          in progress Mr. J. W. Taylor, Jun., Captain Dalgety, the squire and
          patron of the living accompanied by his wife, the Vicar, and others,
          listened to the excellent striking outside the church. At the
          conclusion of the peal the Vicar hospitably entertained the ringers
          at the vicarage.
